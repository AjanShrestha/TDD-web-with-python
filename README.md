# Test-Driven Web Development With Python

This repository contains all the example code from my book, "Test-Driven Web Development with Python", available at www.obeythetestinggoat.com

## Checking out code for individual chapters

Each chapter in the book has its own branch, which contains all the commits for that chapter. So, the state of the code in a branch is the state of the code at the end of that chapter.

In other words, if you want to start on a particular chapter in the book, you should check out the code for the previous chapter.

So, eg, [chapter_01](https://github.com/AjanShrestha/TDD-web-with-python/tree/chapter_01) has all the commits up to the end of chapter 1, so it's the branch to check out if you want to skip to the beginning of chapter 2.
